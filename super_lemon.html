        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>1 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup half-and-half cream</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons grated lemon zest</li>
                <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>Â¾ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
    <!-- Recipe -->
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine heavy cream, sugar, half-and-half, and lemon zest in a saucepan; bring to a simmer over low heat. <br> Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover the saucepan, and allow to steep for 10 minutes. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Uncover the saucepan and bring back to a simmer over low heat. Beat egg yolks in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk 1 cup hot cream mixture into eggs, several tablespoons at a time. <br>(This brings eggs up to temperature without scrambling them.) Stir egg mixture back into cream mixture in the saucepan. <br>Cook and stir over low heat until mixture coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Stir lemon juice into chilled ice cream mixture. Freeze in a 4- to 5-quart ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions. <br>Transfer ice cream to a lidded freezer container, then freeze for about 4 hours to ripen flavors before serving. </li>
            </ol>
